         The beauty and relaxing feel surrounding Cape May goes back over 100 years. 
         One of the reasons Cape May remains a popular East Coast destination is its beautifully restored Victorian-era hotels and B&Bs.

         Nothing in Cape May is as famous as Congress Hall. It began life in 1816 as a simple boarding house for summer visitors to one 
         of America's earliest seaside resorts. Today it is the heart of tourism in this sprawling beach town.

         At the heart of its popularity above all else is its beaches. Cape May County beaches in the southern end of the Jersey shore are known for
          their wide, fine, powdery sand, and are considered to be among the best beaches on the Atlantic coast.
